          </h3>

            Ever wondered why international students pick Australia as their
            preferred study abroad study destination? Instead of wondering what
            Australia has, you should understand that there is almost nothing
            that Australia does not have. The education, some of the best
            universities offer there, is affordable compared to its competitors
            the USA and UK.<strong> </strong>Hence the number of students each
            year in Australia are growing huge. In the 2019 U21

          <h3><strong>Cauldron of Different Cultures</strong></h3>

          <hr />
          <p class="para">
            Australia is third behind the United States and the United Kingdom
            in the past several years in regards to the number of international
            students. At least <strong>700,000 foreign</strong>
            <strong>students</strong> attend the universities in Australia. So
            there are high chances that you might meet people from your own
            country in Australia very easily. International students have always
            been welcomed in Australia by major Universities by providing
            programs and services which will help the students conveniently to
            make the most of their educational experience. Thus with study
            abroad programs, Australia is becoming increasingly more popular
            around the world.

            <strong>high-quality academic programs</strong> in scientific
            fields, like Chemistry, Biology, Zoology, Wildlife, Mathematics,
            nursing, and health care etc. Technology and engineering are found

          <p class="para">
            The well-defined learning system of the country ensures the desired
            outcome from the academic programs. Most of the courses undertaken
            by the students are covered by the Australian Government known as
            <strong>Australian Qualification Framework ( AFQ).</strong> Thus,
            despite being a small nation, Australia is better known as being
            home to some of the best research institutions on the whole
            worldwide. The study program in Australia is a valuable addition to
            every student&#39;s professional resume because the educational
            degrees obtained here are recognized all over the world.
          </p>

            choose from. There are more than 40 Universities in Australia and
            each one of them offers vast and varied opportunities to study a
            range of different subjects. Just as any course of study in any
            American University, there are Universities in Australia like

          <h3><strong>Scholarship and Research Opportunities</strong></h3>

          <hr />
          <p class="para">
            Many students are forced to crash their dreams of studying abroad
            when it comes to their financial background. Their hope for
            international education can be retained. There are a lot of
            scholarship opportunities waiting for international students in
            Australia. These scholarships would cover the undergraduate and
            postgraduate studies as well as vocational training.

              ><em
                >Australian government has set aside over $200 million dollars
                especially for the international students who aspire</em
              ></strong
            ><strong> to study at Australian universities. </strong>These
            scholarships are based on many criteria such as financial need and
            grading requirements.
          </p>

          <h3><strong>Part-time Work while you study</strong></h3>

          <hr />
          <p class="para">
            On a student visa every international student can work part-time to
            support their education in Australia. They would be able to work in
            jobs which only require basic skills such as in the food and
            beverage services, petrol pumps, or in their own University campus.
            With the help of the minimum wage in Australia which is currently
            $18.93 per hour to $23.66 for casual workers, International Students
            can meet their expenses and rent, groceries, utilities, and maybe
            also their some amount of tuition fee.
          </p>

          <p class="para">
            Remember that there is dignity in every labour and no jobs should be
            considered demeaning. That is why, these part-time jobs are
            something that can really help you in covering the expenses
            regarding the cost of education and living expenses; although
            <strong
              >the cost of living in Australia is considerably less when </strong
            >compared to countries like the UK and USA.
          </p>

          <h3><strong>Australian Accent</strong></h3>

          <hr />
          <p class="para">
            You don&rsquo;t have to worry about the language of Australia, even
            though studying in a country where the English Language is not the
            primary language might cause many challenges for the international
            students when they go for simple tasks like asking for directions or
            when you go shopping. But within no time, every student will be able
            to keep up with the lazy Australian accent.
          </p>

          <h3><strong>Great Weather</strong></h3>

          <hr />

            The weather in most parts of Australia is pleasant. This great
            weather Australia enjoys is an added bonus for students. But,
            indeed, there are places in Australia which do have a colder
            climate, but most of the places in Australia have a moderately warm
            climate. Australia has breathtaking landscapes with golden beaches
            and gorgeous rainforests.<strong> </strong>The beaches in Australia,
            especially,&nbsp; are a great attractive element for tourists. Most
            of the top universities are in Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney which
            have a temperature that is usually above 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Keep
            in mind that the Southern Hemisphere of Australian climate has
            seasons reversed and Christmas is warm and sunny.
          </p>

            in huge money received in India. One AUD (Australian Dollar) equals
            to&nbsp; 52.24 Rupee in Indian currency. Thus, if you save more it

            qualification and also for job opportunities. Another beneficial
            factor if you study further in Australia is that you will be able to
            get more time to be eligible for
            <strong>post-study work opportunities</strong>, by meeting the
            <strong><em>Australian Study Requirement </em></strong>which would
            require two or more academic years. The students who meet the
