          <p class="para">
            New Zealand has a picturesque landscape which has a beautiful
            natural environment and it is particularly diverse. The name
            wanderlust suits the country as all kinds of natural landscapes
            ranging from snow-capped mountains and steaming volcanoes to rolling
            green hills, golden sandy beaches and lush rainforests.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <h3><strong>Less Population</strong></h3>

          <hr />
          <p class="para">
            New Zealand is a quite relaxed and stress-free country with a
            population of only 4.5 million. Your overall experience in New
            Zealand would be one of calmness and stress-free with one storey
            high houses having large gardens.
          </p>

          <h3><strong>Pleasant Climate</strong></h3>

          <hr />
          <p class="para">
            The weather of New Zealand is very quiet throughout the year with a
            largely temperate climate. While the far north has subtropical
            weather during summer and inland alpine areas of the South Island
            can only be -10 C in winter, most of the country lies close to the
            coast, which means mild temperatures, moderate rainfall, and
            abundant sunshine.
          </p>

          <h3>
            <strong>Liberal Visa Application and Residency Process</strong>
          </h3>

          <hr />
          <p class="para">
            New Zealand has liberal immigration laws unlike other countries
            which make it easy to obtain a student visa. Rather than giving a
            blunt rejection like most of the countries, New Zealand will give
            you a chance to speak to a visa expert in order to explain your case
            if they don&rsquo;t accept your visa.
          </p>

          <p class="para">
            Furthermore, New Zealand proves to be the ideal destination for the
            people who are looking to discover and build a new life rather than
            just to live abroad for a few years. Because, after you graduate,
            you can work in the country for up to a year and can apply for
            permanent residency if you acquire a job which is related to the
            degree you studied.
