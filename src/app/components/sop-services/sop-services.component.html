          <h3>How to write an effective Statement of Purpose</h3>

          <hr />

          <p class="para">
            This blog contains everything that you needed to know while writing
            a perfect SOP. You will need a multitude of essays to get into an
            institution abroad. But mainly, there are two types of essays that
            appear more often than the others.
            <strong
              >One is your personal statement and the other is SOP.</strong
            >
          </p>

          <p class="para">
            <strong>A personal statement</strong> is all about your personal
            experience which includes your work, volunteer experiences, and the
            things that had happened in your past which made you the person you
            are today to get inspired to arrive at this current position to
            apply for this particular program. This personal statement is
            typically used by the admissions office to determine whether you fit
            into their student body.
          </p>

          <p class="para">
            <strong>SOP or a Statement of Purpose</strong>, on the other hand,
            is an essay in which you state the purpose of applying to a
            particular course in a particular university. This essay must
            consist of a gist of who you really are, who you want to become, and
            more importantly, how ready you are to pursue a certain course in a
            particular institution that you chose to apply. So SOP will help the
            admission counsellors to determine whether you are a right for their
            program or not.
          </p>

          <p class="para">
            Generally, an undergraduate program asks you for a personal
            statement and graduate schools ask you to submit a statement of
            purpose but sometimes also additionally CV and personal statement as
            well.
          </p>

          <p class="para">
            SOP is a&nbsp; bridge between your past experience and your future
            that you want to build while studying a particular program at the
            institution that you have opted. SOP helps the admission counsellors
            to decide whether you are the right fit for the program at their
            school. Hence a well-written SOP can open up the doors of best
            institutions for you as well as the prospect of getting a full
            scholarship for the courses you dream about (even if you have lower
            grades by chance).
          </p>

          <p class="para">
            Most of the time, the non- native English speakers tend to think
            that SOP is a platform to showcase your skills in the language. That
            is not true at all, instead, your TOEFL and IELTS is the better
            indicator of your English language proficiency.
          </p>

          <p class="para">
            SOP is in simple words is a single-page summary of a person. In
            objectively designed application form, there is hardly anything to
            judge upon aptitude and future prospects. But by reading an SOP, the
            reader is able to determine what this person might be like when put
            in the demanding world of academics. It can tell a compelling story
            which a plain application form with only certificates and grades
            cannot ever tell.
          </p>

          <p class="para">
            The process of writing an SOP may seem difficult because the formula
            to write an SOP is often vague and open-ended. So before you start
            writing the essays for your admissions it would be advisable that
            you write down to list out all your credentials: experience, awards,
            certificates down on a piece of paper and divide them into three
            main categories: (1) the information you want to write to your
            resume or CV, (2) the information you want in your statement of
            purpose and (3) stories you like to talk in your personal statement.
          </p>

          <p class="para">
            Let&#39;s look at some important information that you must include
            while you write your admission essays to make it easier for you to
            remember and relate.
          </p>

          <h3>Purpose</h3>
          <hr />
          <p class="para">
            The first thing you should notice during the articulation of your
            SOP essay is to make sure that you convey your interest and goals.
            Hence try to answer the questions:&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p class="para">
            Why do you want to do this particular degree?&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p class="para">
            Is there any research interest that you want to full fill through
            this degree?
          </p>

          <p class="para">
            (If you are taking a professional degree) What are the skills that
            you hope to get by taking this program?
          </p>

          <p class="para">
            What do you want to do after completing this program?
          </p>

          <h3>Past Experience</h3>
          <hr />
          <p class="para">
            While addressing the past experience, you just have to make sure you
            answer the following questions, which are:
          </p>

          <p class="para">WHAT - experience?</p>

          <p class="para">WHAT KIND OF- experience?</p>

          <p class="para">HOW MUCH- experience?</p>

          <p class="para">
            What skills do you hope to gain from this program (if you already
            have experience)?
          </p>

          <p class="para">
            How does your past experience related to this program?
          </p>

          <p class="para">
            It is important that you produce vivid concrete examples of your
            work that you have done. Like for example, a project that you have
            done earlier that relates directly to the course you are opting to
            study or you may have written a paper that got published somewhere
            or a presentation or you had worked with a mentor which relates to
            the program you are pursuing to achieve. When you present such
            proofs you can make the authorities believe that you are ready for
            graduate school.
          </p>

          <h3>Program</h3>
          <hr />
          <p class="para">
            The program is truly the most important aspect of the whole SOP.
            While explaining the program you should first answer the question
            that:&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p class="para">
            Why do you want to study in that country? (You can skip this
            question if you are opting the US)
          </p>

          <p class="para">
            Why do you want to study at that college? (Show it in your answer
            that you have done good research on the college and are really
            interested in joining it)
          </p>

          <p class="para">
            How does your work connect with the program and how the program
            fulfils your interests and needs?
          </p>

          <p class="para">What are your expectations from the program?</p>

          <p class="para">How are you going to contribute to the program?</p>

          <p class="para">
            Does the department have a research methodology that you like?
          </p>

          <p class="para">
            Is there a particular facet of curriculum that you prefer?
          </p>

          <p class="para">
            Are there any particular professors that you want to work with? (If
            there is a professor in the department that done work along the
            lines of your aspiration, you can refer to that professor in your
            SOP and ca even contact that professor beforehand)
          </p>

          <p class="para">
            Having done all this research you can easily convince them that you
            are genuinely interested in the program and is ready to work hard to
            get into this course.
          </p>

          <h3>Personality</h3>
          <hr />
          <p class="para">
            The personality is what is about you which makes you unique. It
            indicates those one or two things about your personality that you
            want to showcase to your admission officers. The personality of
            yourself that connects to the personality of the college that you
            choose also shows your knowledge of the student body and how do you
            think that you will fit in it.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <h3>Simple English</h3>
          <hr />
          <p class="para">
            To communicate clearly effectively and logically you should use
            simple language. There always is a tendency to use very difficult
            vocabulary to make your SOP look exotic. But that is not tall a
            right approach to writing your SOP.&nbsp; You just have to use
            simple vocabulary in order for the readers to understand it clearly.
            There is often a tempting tendency to make someone else write your
            SOP for you. But even if writing it consume so much time, you should
            write it your own. Sometimes the examiners have a way of connecting
            your SOP with your previous writings like your TOEFL score or IELTS
            score or some other samples of essay you wrote or SAT exam. So you
            should maintain authenticity, uniqueness, and honesty while writing.
          </p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Start Early</h3>
          <hr />
          <p class="para">
            If the process in which you wrote your SOP is right, the end result
            will definitely be excellent. The first thing to be varied in the
            process is that you must start early. Try to compose your SOP 3-4
            months prior. After writing and re-writing repeatedly will only you
            realize the deeper meaning of your words and can polish it finally
            to produce a perfect of SOP.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <h3>Some tips to write a good SOP&nbsp;</h3>
          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Creating a really an SOP that is very different from others and is
              unique is the main key. The contents of you SOP should linger on
              the mind of the admission long after he/she reads it.&nbsp;
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Rather than beginning your SOP with some regular ordinary
              statements, you should begin it with any quotes or anecdotes or
              even some experience of yours that will connect directly to the
              course that you want to pursue and that will be a good way to
              impress the officers.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Read examples of SOPs from the internet but make sure that you
              never ever lift any single the lines from it.&nbsp;
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Make sure you stick on to the instructions and lastly you should
              proofread your SOP to find out any kind of grammatical errors as
              well as lexical faults.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Show your final piece to any number of people( professor, any
              relative worked in the same area, friends, seniors) and listen to
              their suggestions and feedback and don&#39;t be worried about the
              negative comments.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              If there is a word limit given, stick on to it. (If there is no
              word limit, don&#39;t let your SOP exceed two pages)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Don&#39;t overuse the words &quot;I&quot; or too much of slang
              like &quot;can&rsquo;t&quot;, &quot;won&#39;t&quot; or any short
              forms.&nbsp;
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Keep your personal information to a limit.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Use any hearing app and let the computer read your SOP back to
              you.
            </li>
          </ul>
